<p>In keeping with his work history and passion for science, Jason is a strong advocate of better STEM opportunities in Brentwood
Schools. He plans to encourage more girls and minorities to pursue careers in coding by pushing for more consistent coding opportunities
in younger grades. Jason believes in all students receiving education that requires critical thinking and provides real challenges.
He plans to use his influence to improve services for Brentwood's gifted children, a great resource our country depends upon!
However, he believes all children need the opportunity to accomplish great things in technology like create science projects with 
expert teacher supervision, build robots, write programs, create websites, etc. Also, playing board games like Go, chess, and newer
euro games (e.g. Cataan, Pandemic, and Forbidden Island) provides invaluable logical gifts to students, far surpassing the memorization of
vocabulary words and other mindless educational holdovers. Jason has donated his board games to Brentwood classrooms and will continue
to do so, to encourage our students to take part in the current board game renaissance in our culture.</p>
<p>In addition to his passion for STEM and logic in the schools, Jason is a politically conscious individual and a serious champion
of civil rights. He makes yearly contributions to the <a href=:https://www.aclu.org/">ACLU</a>, <a href="https://www.operationfoodsearch.org/">
Operation Food Search</a>, <a href="https://ffrf.org/">The Freedom From Religion Foundation</a>, and <a href="http://news.stlpublicradio.org/#stream/0">
St. Louis Public Radio</a>. He supports measures that would help bridge racial and gender-based achievement gaps. He believes in honoring diversity
in work places and listening to those who have historically been silenced.</p>
